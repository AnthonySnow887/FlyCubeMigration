Summary     : Tool for creating, installing, reverting database migrations
Description :
FlyCubeMigration is a tool developed in Python that follows the ideology and principles of database migration found in Ruby on Rails.
FlyCubeMigration completely repeats the functionality of the migration core implemented in the MVC Web Framework FlyCubePHP.
Installation of each migration is performed in transactional mode and in case of errors, rolls back the state of the database to the stage before installation.
